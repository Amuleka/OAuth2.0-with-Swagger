# Overview

In this project, I wanted to show a little bit of OAuth 2.0 and Swagger (API Documentation)

I'm using an MVC architecture to separate business logic, API calls, and initialization processes, as well as a swagger.json and swagger.js to handle different calls using the swagger npm packages

I wanted to show how easy it is to create API documentation for yourself and also for your team. Anyone can write clean API documentation using swagger npm packages since the beginning of your project.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode as my code editor, the REST Client extension, and express, dot-env, MongoDB, and body-parser npm packages

I used Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, and Swagger(API Documentation)

# Useful Websites

- [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)

# Future Work

- In future work, I would like to add more collections to show more examples on API calls
- I could add more descriptions and best practices on how to write better API documentation using swagger
